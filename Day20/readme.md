<h3>Shared Memory IPC</h3>

<pre>
🔹 1. Writer Process (process1)
## Shared Memory Steps

- Creates a shared memory segment using `shmget()`
- Attaches to the memory using `shmat()`
- Writes data to shared memory
- Detaches using `shmdt()`
- Deletes the segment using `shmctl()`

🔹 2. Reader Process (reader)
- Accesses the same shared memory segment using the same key with shmget().
- Attaches to the shared memory using shmat().
- Reads and displays the data written by the writer process.
- Detaches from the shared memory using shmdt().
-Finally, deletes the shared memory segment using shmctl() with IPC_RMID.

📌 Key Concepts Demonstrated
-ftok(): Generates a unique key using a filename and integer.
-shmget(): Creates or accesses a shared memory segment.
-shmat(): Attaches the segment to the process's address space.
-shmdt(): Detaches the shared memory after use.
-shmctl(): Used by the reader to clean up (remove) the memory segment.
