<h2>🍁Thread</h2>
<pre>
  A thread is a lightweight, independent flow of execution within a process.
All threads in the same process share memory but run independently.

✅ Example:
If your app has:

♦One thread for reading data

♦One thread for writing data

♦One thread for displaying results

They can run in parallel, making your app faster and more responsive.
